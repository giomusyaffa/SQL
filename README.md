# SQL Portfolio 💻
## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! 👋
This repository contains my personal projects exploring data analysis and insights generation using Structured Query Language (SQL). Each project is based on real-world datasets sourced from Kaggle and aims to showcase how SQL can be used to clean, transform, and analyze data effectively.

## Objectives 🎯
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.

- Data Transformation: Using joins, subqueries, CASE statements, and CTEs to organize data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Finding trends, distributions, and performance indicators.

- Business Insights: Translating numbers into actionable insights for decision-making.

## Setup 🔧
### Step 1: Install Microsofr SQL Server

This is the database engine, it’s where all your tables and data are stored.

What it does:

- Stores and manages data tables.
- Runs SQL queries.
- Handles relationships between datasets.

### Step 2: Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Now, this is the interface, the program where you actually type your SQL code.

What it does:

- Lets you type, run, and visualize SQL queries.
- Displays all your databases, tables, and relationships.
- Helps you create backups, import CSVs, and view results easily.

## Projects 📂

### 1. Customer Sentiment Dataset 🛍️
**Description**

The Customer Sentiment Dataset contains customer demographics, reviews, ratings, product categories, and issue resolution information.

This makes it ideal for practicing real-world SQL queries that answer business questions.
