# SQL Portfolio 💻
## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! 👋
This repository contains my personal projects exploring data analysis and insights generation using Structured Query Language (SQL). Each project is based on real-world datasets sourced from Kaggle and aims to showcase how SQL can be used to clean, transform, and analyze data effectively.

## Objectives 🎯
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.

- Data Transformation: Using joins, subqueries, CASE statements, and CTEs to organize data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Finding trends, distributions, and performance indicators.

- Business Insights: Translating numbers into actionable insights for decision-making.
